# Coffee Ratings EDA

In this exploratory analysis, we have used the dataset that was originally scraped from the Coffee Quality Institute (CQI) reviews page.
CQI is a non-profit that offers a standardization system for grading high quality coffees to help bring them to the market.
After their review process (termed coffee cupping), fresh coffee beans are assessed on ten different measures with a possible score of 0-10 for a final score of 0-100. In addition, the dataset includes information about country of origin and the region’s altitudes in meters.  The two types of beans (species) that go through CQI’s verification system are Arabica and Robusta.
