In this exploratory analysis, we have used the dataset that was originally scraped from the Coffee Quality Institute (CQI) reviews page. CQI is a non-profit that offers a standardization system for grading high quality coffees to help bring them to the market. After their review process (termed coffee cupping), fresh coffee beans are assessed on ten different measures with a possible score of 0-10 for a final score of 0-100. In addition, the dataset includes information about country of origin and the region’s altitudes in meters.  The two types of beans (species) that go through CQI’s verification system are Arabica and Robusta.

# Data

Check data cleanliness
```{r}
(na_count <-sapply(coffee_ratings, function(y) sum(length(which(is.na(y)))))) 
```

Check data types
```{r}
glimpse(coffee_ratings)
```
# EDA

Proportions of coffee species
```{r}
table(coffee_ratings['species'])
```
Check altitude distributions
```{r}
altitudes <- c("altitude_low_meters",	"altitude_high_meters",	"altitude_mean_meters")
coffee_ratings %>%
  select(altitudes) %>%
  gather(na.rm = TRUE) %>%
  ggplot(aes(value)) +
  facet_wrap(~ key, scales = "free") +
  geom_density()
```
Chech out the extreme values
```{r}
sort(coffee_ratings$altitude_mean_meters, decreasing = TRUE) %>% head(10)
```

After removing erroneous values
```{r}
coffee_ratings %>%
  select(altitude_mean_meters) %>%
  filter(altitude_mean_meters<4300) %>% 
  gather(na.rm = TRUE) %>%
  ggplot(aes(value)) +
  facet_wrap(~ key, scales = "free") +
  geom_density()
```
Check distribution of grades
```{r}
grades <- c("aroma",	"flavor",	"aftertaste",	"acidity",	"body",	"balance",	"uniformity",	"clean_cup",	"sweetness",	"cupper_points",	"total_cup_points")

coffee_ratings %>%
  select(grades) %>% 
  gather() %>%
  ggplot(aes(value)) +
  facet_wrap(~ key, scales = "free") +
  geom_density()
```
Check total score stats
```{r}
summary(coffee_ratings$total_cup_points)
```
Chech out the extreme values
```{r}
sort(coffee_ratings$total_cup_points) %>% head(10)
```
Only one zero value

```{r}
coffee_ratings %>% 
  filter(total_cup_points == 0) %>% 
  select(grades)
```
Received zero on all measures

```{r}
coffee_ratings %>%
  filter(total_cup_points > 0) %>% 
  select(grades) %>%
  gather() %>%
  ggplot(aes(value)) +
  facet_wrap(~ key, scales = "free") +
  geom_density()
```
It's easy to score high on clean cup, uniformity, and sweetness?
"Uniformity refers to consistency of flavor of the different cups of the sample tasted."
"Clean Cup refers to a lack of interfering negative impressions from first ingestion to final aftertaste"
"Sweetness" no longer part of the CQI scale?
"Acidity is often described as "brightness" when favorable or "sour" when unfavorable. At its best, acidity contributes to a coffee's liveliness, sweetness, and fresh- fruit character and is almost immediately experienced and evaluated when the coffee is first slurped into the mouth"

Countries represented
```{r}
coffee_ratings %>% 
  count(country_of_origin, sort=TRUE) %>% 
  top_n(20) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(reorder(country_of_origin, n), (n)))+
  geom_col()+
  coord_flip()+
  ylab("Countries")+xlab("Count")
```
```{r}
coffee_ratings %>% 
  count(country_of_origin, sort=TRUE) %>% 
  top_n(12) %>% 
  select(country_of_origin) -> top12countries
```

Order countries by rating and highlight altitude
```{r}
coffee_ratings[coffee_ratings$country_of_origin %in% top12countries[["country_of_origin"]],] %>%
filter(total_cup_points > 0) %>%
mutate(country = fct_reorder(country_of_origin, total_cup_points, .fun = max)) %>%
filter(total_cup_points > 0, altitude_mean_meters <=3500) %>%
ggplot(aes(country, total_cup_points, color=altitude_mean_meters, )) + geom_point() + coord_flip() +scale_color_viridis(option = "D") +
  labs(x="Country", y="Average Rating", color="Mean altitude")

```


```{r}
#model total score vs different grades
coffee_ratings[coffee_ratings$total_cup_points>0,] %>% select(total_cup_points, grades) %>% pivot_longer(-total_cup_points, names_to = "Measures", values_to = "Score")%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = total_cup_points, y = Score))+
  geom_point(alpha = 0.8, size=0.1) +
  geom_smooth(method="lm", na.rm = TRUE, se = FALSE)+
  coord_flip() +
  facet_wrap(vars(Measures)) +
  ylab("Measure")+
  xlab("Total score")+
  stat_fit_glance(method = 'lm',
                  method.args = list(formula = y ~ x),  geom = "text_npc", 
                  aes(label = paste("p=", signif(..p.value.., digits = 0), 
                                    "\nR^2=", signif(..r.squared.., digits = 2), sep = "")),
                  label.x = "right", label.y = "bottom", size = 2)
